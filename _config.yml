    StormBit is an IRC network dedicated to anything you can think
    of from open source projects, to video games, to anime culture,
    we have a little of every community, so you can feel right at home.
    We also strongly believe in free speech and take a very hands-off
    approach to moderation, so if you can't find a channel that suits you,
    come on and make one!
