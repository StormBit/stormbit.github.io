After a seemingly endless week, the TempCraft and StormBit forums are back.  
However, both communities now share the same forum-base in an effort to promote unity and also to increase moderation efficiency. (I swear server load wasn't a part of it. :p)

TempCraft Forum Staff have been moved into their own groups, with the same permissions as before, and vice versa for StormBit staff.  
No posts have been lost in the process, and all accounts will be converted to the new database schema at first login. You may need to adjust your signatures, and we appologize in advance for the inconvenience.

Our priorities over the past week (for anyone who is interested) consist of:

 * Optimising the webserver
 * Merging the two forums as seamlessly as possible.
 * Migrating away to a better structured forum software.
 * Finding and adapting a suitable theme (we have also had to repair it quite significantly).
 * Restructuring staff and the forum as a whole.

As for the reasoning behind the merger; we figured that since the majority of the staff behind each were the same, and the resources were also being shared, there was no point seperating the two entirely.

Of course, with any major change, there will be those who will protest. To you, we say: Give us a chance to prove you wrong.  
If you have any suggestions, please go ahead and post them in the Suggestions subforum, or alternatively contact one of the Team members via our IRC network.

And in case you haven't figured it out yet, you can escape this portal by either clicking on the Logo, or the "StormBit" button to the side, or most of the links in the left sidebar.

Enjoy!

&mdash; StormBit Team
