As I'm sure you've noticed, there have been no updates on this site's frontpage!
Now, the reasoning for this is twofold.

Firstly, we're actually working on a new site specially adapted to our needs as an IRC network. It'll be far easier to navigate, to update and will also be blazingly fast (not that the current setup isn't, but the random downtime courtesy of Cloudflare will be gone). This means we'll finally be able to allow anyone to post updates to the site without having to navigate a cluttered interface and deal with BBCode, so that for example ArghArgh200 will be able to post updates regarding his StormBitGames services.

Secondly, and I'm sure this will come as no surprise to the majority, we're very very good at procrastinating. Especially when it comes to *really* **important** things. We're talking **super-high priority** here. Things such as... Drafting up an official User Policy, deciding upon what to include in our Privacy Policy and well, these newsposts.
Fear not, however, for these days are long over. We've made a few adjustments to our staff, which will be detailed shortly after our new site goes up, and now have greater freedom and the capacity to *actually get important things done.* (As an example of this, our network has finally switched over to a decentralized setup without any major hiccups).

So, wave goodbye to the current portal and wiki. The forums will remain intact, just they will be made available from a subdomain. It certainly has been a journey since these forums were originally installed, but... you'll have to wait for the full story. In the meantime, I personally suggest that you follow our [Twitter account (@StormBit)](https://twitter.com/stormbit), as it is apparently now being made use of.

And finally, thank-you for using the StormBit IRC Network.
