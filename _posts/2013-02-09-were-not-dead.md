It's been a while since any posts were made here on the StormBit forums. I'd just like to let you all know that we aren't dead, and the IRC network is very much alive. If you're wondering where all the activity is at, go ahead and point your IRC client at #sting on irc.stormbit.net (or just use Iris, our web IRC client.)

Expect some more updates and some changes in the near future~
