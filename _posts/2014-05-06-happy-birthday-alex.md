A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...  
**Stormbit IV: A New Post**  

It is a period of shitslinging. Rebel  
networks, shitstirring from a crappy  
channel, have gotten totally rekt by  
the glorious StormBit Empire.  

After the battle, StormBit users started  
to get bored with the network's lack of  
control - thanks to L4D2, and lazy opers with enough  
free time to build an entire planet (in minecraft).  

Harrassed by the network's frustrated users,  
Alex Wilson sets about to make his opers work more, in  
hope that that can save his channels and  
restore peace and discussion to the network...  

####Happy Birthday, Alex!####

Thank you based Alex for pushing StormBit, opers and users alike, to make the network a neat place to be. Happy birthday, you're a good egg.
It wouldn't be a birthday without a birthday present, however.
