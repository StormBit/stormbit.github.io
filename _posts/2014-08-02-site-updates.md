If you've been paying attention to the StormBit website over the past few months, you might have noticed it change. You may have also noticed that those changes have occurred... rather slowly. Well, I'm writing to let you know that things are starting to move along a little faster. ^-^ 

As of today, we aim to be both updating the front page with news, and to be adding brand new content (in the form of help guides, information about StormBit, and so on) to the site every few days at a constant rate. As well as new content, the development of the website itself will be progressing much more quickly, with two new additions to the development team working on fixing many existing bugs and adding extra features to boot.  

Meanwhile, on the IRC side of things, recently our network channel #stormbit has seen a significant increase in channel activity! So if you're looking for somewhere to chat, you're more likely than ever to find a conversation in the main channel! :)
