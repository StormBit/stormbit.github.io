#GaleForce Games

##What is it?
Game servers! Aren't those great? We originally intended it to be sort of a community-only thing but soon realized that it was silly to only let our regulars on the network join, so we decided to open it up to the general public!

##What are the rules for the servers?
These are sort of a general idea on what our rules are.

1. Be respectful to the game, the server, the users, and the admins. Especially the users.
2. Don't exploit glitches to gain an advantage, or otherwise cheat or abuse the games.
3. Try your best to have fun without taking the fun away from others.

##Okay, how do I connect?
Well, there's a few different servers. At the moment we have:

- [Space Engineers Freeplay Factions/PvP, sbg.arghlex.net:25252](<steam://connect/sbg.arghlex.net:25252>)
- [Garry's Mod Prop Hunt, sbg.arghlex.net:15151](<steam://connect/sbg.arghlex.net:15151>)
- [Team Fortress 2 Capture-the-flag, sbg.arghlex.net:35353](<steam://connect/sbg.arghlex.net:35353>)
- Xonotic Deathmatch Server, sbg.arghlex.net:28000

with plans to announce:

- Unreal Tournament 2004 Onslaught
- Unreal Tournament 2004 and 1999 Deathmatch servers

##Alright! Awesome! Do you have an IRC channel for me to lurk in?
Yes! We have [#galeforce](<ircs://irc.stormbit.net:6697/galeforce>) on the IRC network!

##Voice Chat server?
[We do have a TeamSpeak3 server!](<ts3server://ts3.galeforce.me:9987/>)

##Got Minecraft?
If you want to play Minecraft, we have an agreement with [VaultCraft](<//vaultcraft.net>) for your various tastes in Minecraft servers.
