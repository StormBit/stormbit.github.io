Originally founded as a short-lived albeit briefly successful forum community, we first opened our
doors as an IRC network in early 2011 and have been expanding ever since.  We couldn't have made it
this far without the help and support of our donors and the members of the InspIRCd and Atheme
projects. Thanks guys, you're awesome.
