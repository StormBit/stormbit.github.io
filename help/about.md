## Welcome to StormBit! ##
First and foremost, StormBit is an IRC network.  That means we host secure chatrooms for individuals and
  communities on our international network of servers.

Whether you're an individual or represent an internet community, we believe we can fulfil your hosting needs
  and if you take the time to get in touch with us, you'll find us very flexible in our ability to 
  support the growth of communities.


## Our ”Hands-off” approach to moderation... ##
We don't fuss around with menial details such as who you are and what you are doing - our philosophy is such
  that so long as you aren't abusing the service we provide, typically by attacking or harassing other users
  or by violating regional laws with which we comply, we will not interfere with you unless you request some
  kind of assistance.
  
For further clarification, be sure to read our [policies](/help/policies.html), or ask a member of staff.


## Where we come from... ##
Originally founded as a short-lived albeit briefly successful forum community, we first opened our
  doors as an IRC network in early 2011 and have been expanding ever since.

It's been a shaky road since then, we've had our fair share of ups and downs and have both lost and gained some
  excellent members of staff.
  
In 2011, and for the bulk of 2012, we maintained a Janus link with the Tsukihime and the ArchivesMC IRC 
  networks, but have since discontinued the use of this software out of a concern for the vulnerabilities it
  presented and the general political complications of cross-network channels subject to conflicting policies.

Our team brings together much technical experience, pooling expertise across many different fields ranging 
  from networking (CCNA yadda, yadda) to plain old system operation.  We have partners who take care of some 
  services (like DNS, cheers Rage4!), but what we do, we do well.


## Some Technical Details... ##
We openly embrace many open-source technologies in order to offer what we feel is the best service available.
Amongst these are:

- The Linux kernel.  Nearly every system we own or maintain runs on the Linux kernel and much of our work is
  only made possible by its sheer flexibility.
- Debian 7. Offering rock-solid stability, and powerful easy-to-use command-line tools, Debian has become 
  something of a de-facto standard for the majority of linux-based servers. Nearly every system in our ‘fleet’ 
  runs some flavour of Debian - Indeed we make extensive use of Debian's package management and maintain our
  own repository to deploy software updates quickly and efficiently.
- Ubuntu Server. For the rest, for systems where both stability and bleeding-edge software is required, there
  is little choice for a production server than Ubuntu.  It just works.  Like Debian, but with newer stuff, 
  and yet still compatible with its packages.
- InspIRCd 2. A hallmark for all IRC server software, we believe InspIRCd speaks for itself. Everything is 
  a module, enabling networks to scale up and cherrypick the features they want to offer.  In our case the 
  unique linking capabilities of InspIRCd make it the perfect choice, with a plethora of nifty security 
  features to  boot.
- Atheme 7. There's much to say about this very unique IRC services package. It's highly scalable, very 
  modular, and offers more functionality than you will ever need right out of the box. Everything about it,
  makes sense, and the learning curve is consequently fairly shallow considering its differences to other 
  packages such as Anope.
- Docker. In the new age of cloud computing, virtualisation software has been the key to success. We found
  a very elegant solution to our needs to rapidly deploy software and better distribute our resources and
  hardware in the form of Docker and its containers. Based on LXC, this works a treat with LTS releases of
  Ubuntu.
