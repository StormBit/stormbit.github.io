title: Banned from Stormbit?
Subtitle: Reasons and Responses to a Network Ban
---

##Introduction

If you've been sent here upon attempting to connect to StormBit's IRC network, chances are you may have been placed on a block list, also known as glined/zlined/klined, depending on the type of block.  
There are a number of reasons why this block may have been placed. You may have violated one of our guidelines shown [here](http://stormbit.net/help/policies.html) in some way, shape or form. 


##Common Ban Reasons
In short, you __may__ have:

- Threatened, stalked, or abused a user in some way, shape, or form.

- Withheld information you were legally required to share with StormBit.

- Evaded ignores or bans.

- Created a channel for the explicit purpose of attacking a user or organization, even if they are not a participant of StormBit's IRC network.

- Abused services in a manner that disrupted user activities or threatened the integrity of the network.

- Another possibility, especially on mobile/cellular phones with highly dynamic IPs, is you have "inherited" an IP address that was previously blocked.

This list is not all-inclusive. The actual ban reason will be included in the message directing you to this page.

##Appealing

There are a few ways to appeal a network-wide ban. One of the ways __is not__ evading the ban and accessing the network from another address. This method will __most likely__ result in your appeal being denied.
