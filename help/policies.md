By connecting to StormBit you agree to abide by the following rules.
Failure to do so may result in termination of your connection.
You indemnify the network against any damages which may arise from misuse of
their services.

If you have any issues or concerns, you may contact staff via
[IRC](irc://irc.stormbit.net/stormbit "#StormBit on irc.stormbit.net"), or
[email](mailto:abuse@stormbit.net "abuse@stormbit.net").

As a StormBit user, you are expected to respect other users and network staff.

# The following attitudes and actions are __not__ tolerated:

- Threatening, stalking, or abusing other users or the network.
- Withholding information that may be legally relevant to using the network.
- Evading ignores or bans.
- Making channels to attack or disrupt others (even non-users of the network).
- Abusing services to attack or disrupt other users.
- Being a jerk, as a
  [Wikipedian so kindly put it](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_a_jerk).

# Guidelines for staff:

- Staff will not interfere with independent channels (those not owned by the
  network) unless requested by channel owners or, in some cases, operators
  on the channel access list. If asked to step in, staff will make judgement
  calls based on network health and safety.
- All channels are independent of the network, there are no restrictions on
  what is allowed in them as long as they are compliant with United States law and
  don't harm the network or other users.
- Staff will not abuse their privileges to enforce network or channel rules in
  independent channels, unless in compliance with the exceptions outlined below.
- Staff will actively interfere in the case of "stalkers" and other exceptional
  circumstances, regardless of whether you ignored them.
- Staff will actively interfere with any and all entities masquerading as being
  a part of the network, as this is considered a direct attack on both
  new and existing users.
- Staff reserve the right to remove you for any reason without notice or
  warning.

# Guidelines for you:

- Use /ignore if somebody is harassing you and not explicitly breaking any
  rules.  If they persist, please immediately reach out to the staff.
- Bots, file servers, and proxies (including Tor) are allowed, as long as you
  comply with the rest of the rules. Bots should set usermode +B on
  themselves to avoid confusion.
- Our stance on vhosts is rather liberal. Anything goes as long as it doesn't
  explicitly attack other users or their views or is grossly inappropriate.
  Domain names are even allowed, as long as you can prove you represent the
  owner of the domain; however, these cannot be requested through HostServ,
  you need to contact a staff member instead.
- With vhosts, we only ask that you keep it sane.  Explicit vhosts are completely
  allowed, however consider that this is shown to any and all users upon joining a
  channel.
- If found to be in breach of the rules, and this breach is considered negligible
  or an accident, the network staff may message you with a warning.  Failure to comply
  or repeat offenses may result in a ban.
- IP masking is enabled by default. You can set usermode -x on yourself to
  disable this.
