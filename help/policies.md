By connecting to StormBit you agree to abide by the following rules.  Failure to do so may result in
  termination of your connection.  You indemnify the network against any damages which may arise from
  misuse of their services.

If you have any issues or concerns, you may contact staff via 
  [IRC](irc://irc.stormbit.net/stormbit "#StormBit on irc.stormbit.net"), 
  [the forums](//discuss.stormbit.net "discuss.stormbit.net") or
  [email](mailto:abuse@stormbit.net "abuse@stormbit.net").

As a StormBit user, you are expected to respect other users and network staff.

#### The following attitudes and actions are __not__ tolerated: ####

 - Threatening, stalking, or abusing other users or the network.
 - Withholding information that may be legally relevant to using the network.
 - Evading ignores or bans.
 - Making channels to attack others (even non-users of the network).
 - Abusing services to attack or disrupt other users.
 - Being a dick, as [wikipedia so kindly put it](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_a_dick).

#### Guidelines for staff: ####

 - Staff will not interfere with independent channels (those not owned by the network) unless
   requested by channel owners or, in some cases, operators on the channel access list.  If asked to
   step in, staff will make judgement calls based on network health and safety.
 - Staff will not abuse their priveleges to enforce network or channel rules in independent channels.
 - All channels are independent of the network, there are no restrictions on what is allowed in them
   as long as you comply with United States law and don't harm the network or other users.
 - Staff will interfere in the case of "stalkers" and other exceptional circumstances, regardless of
   whether you ignored them.
 - Staff reserve the right to remove you for any reason without notice or warning.

#### Guidelines for you: ####

 - Use /ignore if somebody is harassing you and not explicitly breaking any rules.
 - Bots, file servers, and proxies (including Tor) are allowed, as long as you comply with the rest
   of the rules.  Bots should set usermode +B on themselves.
 - Our stance on vhosts is rather liberal.  Anything goes as long as it doesn't explicitly attack
   other users or their views or is grossly inappropriate.  Domain names are even allowed, as long
   as you can prove you represent the owner of the domain; however, these cannot be requested
   through HostServ, you need to contact a staff member instead.
 - IP masking is enabled by default.  You can set usermode -x on yourself to disable this.
