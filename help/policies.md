By connecting to StormBit you agree to abide by the following rules.
Failure to do so may result in termination of your connection.
You indemnify the network against any damages which may arise from misuse of
their services.

If you have any issues or concerns, you may contact staff via
[IRC](irc://irc.stormbit.net/stormbit "#StormBit on irc.stormbit.net"), or
[email](mailto:abuse@stormbit.net "abuse@stormbit.net").

<small>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).</small>

# As a StormBit user, you are expected to respect other users and network staff.
## The following attitudes and actions __shall not__ be tolerated

- Threatening, stalking, or abusing other users or the network.
- Withholding information that may be legally relevant to using the network.
- Evading ignores or bans.
- Making channels to attack or disrupt others (even non-users of the network).
- Abusing services to attack or disrupt other users.
- Being a jerk, as a
  [Wikipedian so kindly put it](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_a_jerk).

## Guidelines for staff

- Staff _must not_ interfere with independent channels (those not owned by the
  network) unless requested by channel owners or, in some cases, operators
  on the channel access list. If asked to step in, staff will make judgement
  calls based on network health and safety.
- All channels are independent of the network, there are no restrictions on
  what is allowed in them as long as they are compliant with United States law and
  don't harm the network, other networks or other users.
- Staff _must not_ abuse their privileges to enforce network or channel rules in
  independent channels, unless in compliance with the exceptions outlined below.
- Staff _must_ put out notice of any alterations to these rules.
- Staff _shall_ actively interfere in the case of "stalkers" and other exceptional
  circumstances, regardless of whether you ignored them.
- Staff _shall_ actively interfere with any and all entities masquerading as being
  a part of the network, as this is considered a direct attack on both
  new and existing users.
- Staff reserve the right to remove you for any reason without notice or
  warning.

## Guidelines for you

- If somebody is harassing you and not explicitly breaking any rules, at a first
  instance you _should_ use the /ignore functionality built into your IRC client.
  If they persist or attempt to evade this, you _must_ immediately contact the
  network staff.
- Bots, file servers, and proxies (including Tor) are allowed, as long as you
  comply with the rest of the rules. Bots _should_ set usermode +B on
  themselves to avoid confusion.
- Our stance on vhosts is rather liberal. Anything goes as long as it doesn't
  explicitly attack other users or their views or is grossly inappropriate.
  Domain names are even allowed, as long as you can prove you represent the
  owner of the domain; however, while these can be requested through HostServ,
  you _must_ also contact a staff member.
- With vhosts, we only ask that you be reasonable; Explicit vhosts are allowed,
  however please consider that this is shown to any and all users upon joining a
  channel.
- If found to be in breach of the rules, and this breach is considered negligible
  or an accident, the network staff _may_ message you with a warning.  Failure to comply
  or repeat offenses _shall_ result in a ban.
- IP masking is enabled by default. You can set usermode `-x` on yourself to
  disable this.

Changes and alterations to this document may be considered binding two days
(48 hours) after being published.  Alterations and suggestions _may_ be proposed
by anybody at any time, subject to peer-review.
