# What is a Bouncer (BNC)?
Simply put, an IRC bouncer will keep you connected to an IRC network while
you're away, granting you extra functionality such as the ability to read
logs from while you were away.

It's a piece of software that sits between your IRC client, and an IRC server,
acting as a proxy. You connect to it as you would normally, and it connects to
your chosen IRC network, and on the face of it you will not notice any
difference other than that your connection will be retained, and you will be
getting logs of what has transpired in your absence.
This behaviour is completely customisable and can be turned off if it really
bothers you!

If you'd like to know more, please feel free to ask, or 
[alternatively you can read more on Wikipedia](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_%28software%29#IRC).

For those already clued up on what bouncers are, and what they can offer, we are running the latest 
[ZNC bouncer software](//znc.in/) with a slew of custom modules.

We do not currently offer any fancy hostnames, especially since most IRC
networks offer them via services, however should there be enough demand,
we will look at enabling some!

# Advanced Functionality

Some of the more advanced functionality IRC bouncers can offer you include:

- Transparently connect several clients to one IRC network at once.
  (e.g. Keep your laptop, desktop, phone, _and_ tablet connected via the
   same user!)
- Push notifications on your phone, whenever anyone mentions your name.  
  (Requires a push notifications service. We prefer [PushBullet](//pushbullet.com/)).
- Built in cryptology to help keep your channels secure.
- Automatic spam-attack protection.  ZNC can automatically 'detach' you from
  a channel to prevent damage to your client.

# Why StormBNC?

Put together, the team behind StormBit are very experienced with system
administration and in particular with IRC technologies.
We put as much pride in keeping our BNC service running smoothly as we do in
our IRC network.
